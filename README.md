# Temperature Converter PWA

This repository contains the source code for a simple Temperature Converter built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and deployed across multiple platforms as part of **Lab 1: Mobile Application Development**.

## Project Files

The PWA is comprised of the following files:

* **`index.html`**: The main page structure and user interface.
* **`converter.js`**: The core application logic for temperature conversion (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
* **`converter.css`**: The styling for the application.
* **`manifest.json`**: Defines the application metadata (name, icons) to enable installation as a PWA.
* **`sw.js`**: The Service Worker script that enables offline caching and PWA functionality.
* **`icon512.png`**: The application icon.

## Live Deployments

The application has been deployed to demonstrate familiarity with different hosting environments.

## Mobile Application Component

The PWA tasks in this repository are complemented by a separate task involving running a native **Android Temperature Converter** application using **Kotlin code** in **Android Studio**.
